    <p style="font-size:larger;"> <b><i>Rohit Sharma </i></b>is an Indian international cricketer who currently serves as the Vice captain of the Indian ODI and T20 teams.<br> He is the captain of the Mumbai Indians IPL team. The right-handed batsman is better known as ‘The Hitman’ for his hard-hitting ability,<br> and has scored a record three double-centuries in ODIs, with centuries in Test and T20 formats as well. Starting his career at the age of 20,<br> he quickly earned praise for his calm and matured performance. However, a rough patch and an untimely injury had halted his ODI run and his<br> Test debut during his early career. Thanks to the new IPL T20 competition, he was able to showcase his capacity as a batsman, an occasional<br> bowler and a captain. He excelled especially in the limited-over formats after being promoted to the opening spot. Despite a delayed Test<br> debut, he showed class with back-to back centuries in his first two matches</p>
